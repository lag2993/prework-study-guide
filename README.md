# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

Project Prework Study Guide Webpage was started as a means to familiriaze with foundational concepts to prepare for the upcoming bootcamp. Focusing on creating a website, this project leads developers through the fundamentals tools and concepts needed to establish a base case for what future projects will entail. Through this project I learned how to access,communicate and update the Git Hub repository in order to build a website that provided information learned while building the project. All with the goal of not just acquiring a new job but developing myself into a developer that can thrive in this new career change.
